# Accessibility

It is our goal for utala.pona.la to exceed WCAG 2.2 Level AA criterion. 

It currently does not meet this. 

## Features


Currently, our website features things like:
- Multiple ways to reach pages
- Mechanisms to bypass blocks
- Appropriate language tagging
- Appropriate use of landmarks

Usability features include:
- Dark/light modes


## Barriers

There are some pages known to be problematic on this site. 

Currently, nearly all the entries in the image competition do not have appropriate alt tags. Media featured in the humour competition do not have subtitles or audio description. 

These amusing documents are known to have issues:

- [Nasi](/mamtw/toki-en-lipu/lipu-suli/nasi.html)
  - Page is not entirely responsive
  - Language tagging is not consistent
  - Minimum contrast is not met
  - Animations can not be paused
- [pilin pipi](/mamtw/toki-en-lipu/lipu-suli/pilin-pipi.md)
  - Page is not built responsively
- [kasi li toki](/mamtt/lipu-musi/lipu-suli/kasi-li-toki.md)
  - Page relies on color to convey information. 

Additionally, there are some older adminstrative pages that text bolding to indicate headings. 

This page will be updated as accessibility issues are fixed and new ones are found.
