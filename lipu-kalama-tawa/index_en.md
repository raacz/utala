# Sound-Movement-Document Competition #MAMW/#T/#LTW

In other languages, many different styles of artful language documents exist. One method is like this: people recite the document in a group and move their bodies so a viewing person can see and hear that document. But projects like this are nonexistant in Toki Pona! Therefore, jan Jan organized a new competition. Make a document using that method goddamnit!


*Five documents were written for the competition!*  
#1 [toki ala o e toki inli](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1W21rSjx2eyYLjcipFGcmLEa-nQenge7wzLk87Tq-CuE/edit) -  by kulupu kama  
#2 [nanpa pi kipisi ala](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DXcXoUm8vSAGsAtXuhhiMG36jAGgbLGXG6h4b9QrcrY/edit) - by Anonymous  
#3 [tu kuntu](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Tu_kuntu.pdf) - by kala pona Tonyu and kule epiku Atawan  
#4 [mijomi telo](mijomi-telo.pdf) - by jan Sami,  jan Kawa, and jan inwin  
#4 [wi lon](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xl5osTAdUfP96ILzYaHpEnSDcxdDVKZ4t01Y8j9ul7w/edit) - jan Sitowapu

With regards to the group, 'tu kuntu' was really good because of this: the document was very long, and very amusing as well! This means that kala pona Tonyu and kule epiku Atawan were the winners!
