# The Amusing Document Battle has Begun!

## What work is required?

Make an artistic new document and give it to me by the required time. 

## What should my artistic document be?

Notably, there are two paths:
- The first path is small artistic document
- The second path is big artistic document

Similarly, the documents should use only toki pona and only word-based communication. 

Differently, the small document must have words fewer than three hundred. The large document's word amount must be bigger than five hundred. 

**You should submit your own work.** Do not submit other people's works. Large documents can be made in collaboration with other people. 

## What should I talk about in my artistic document?

Talk about anything good you desire. Talk about a strange outer-space place that doesn't exist, a flaming raccoon, a library with all knowledge, and new interesting powerful things from your head and your heard. 

However, do not be bad. Do not elevate bad ideas. Do not talk a lot about sex or bodily destruction. Also, be artistic. Your document should not be appropriate for Wikipedia. Do not only teach. And don't just promote a new toki pona numbering system. 

**Your document should be something new in toki pona and not be a linguistic transformation from a document of a different original language.**

Look at the other competitions. Your work should be similar. 

## When do I need to give my work?

In two months, 2025-07-15. 

## Where should I give my work. 

Give your thing to me (Lakuse) using Discord (@raacz106) or using email (tokipona.sasalin@gmail.com).

### Knowledge needed for submission

Give this knowledge:
- your toki pona name
- your Discord name (if you have one)
- the name of your work
- whether your work is a small document or big document
- you understand that your work's distribution will use CC-BY-SA 4.0

### You can say it like this

"Hi, jan Lakuse. I am jan Kulase. My Discord name is @kulase. My document's name is 'My Good Person.' It is for the small document contest. My work is licensed under [CC-BY-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/)."

(This is just an example. Many other communication styles are possible.)

## What is the battle?

When submissions are all done, everyone will look at the entries and say what they think. We’ll find out which aristic documents the community thinks are the best!

So don’t send your entry to a lot of people or talk about what’s in your entry to a lot of people. **When it’s time to look, no one should know who wrote which entry.**

## What else do I need to know?

When you submit your thing to me, you allow [CC-BY-SA-4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/) to control the distribution of your work. If you don’t like this, then don’t submit!

If you submit work and decide you want to change it, you can resubmit it to me!

In the large document competition, you can submit multiple documents! In the little document competition, submit only once.

Know that I will keep your work on this site so everyone can look at it. If you don’t like this, then don’t submit!

## I want this: a talking knowledge device makes my document

You should make your own document. However, if you want to improve your work using a talking knowledge device I want to know this: *Why* do you want to use a talking knowledge device?

Maybe you feel this: your toki pona ability is small. Therefore, talk to me. I can search for mistakes in your document. Do not use the device. The device doesn't know toki pona well right now. 

Maybe you feel this: your art-making ability is small. You want to augment your art-making ability using the talking knowledge device. Understand: You absolutely can discuss things with me. Maybe you do not want this. I can understand this feeling. Damn!

**If you use the talking knowledge device in your work, then say so.** Do not hide this fact. Many people feel strange because of this technology output and do not want to look at a document a tool has made. Therefore: say this: you used the tool. When I distribute your work I will also share this notice with the audience. 

Two years ago, someone made [tawa suli soweli](/mamtw/toki-en-lipu/lipu-suli/tawa-suli-soweli.md) using ChatGPT. The document was entertaining. 




## I want to use non-word depictions in my work

Talk to me about your desire. I do not allow most depictions. It is my desire that colourful images are adornment. The communication in words is most important. 


## My working ability is not very strong. What support can you offer me?

If your ability is small, then I (jan Lakuse) can offer support in three ways.

Number one, if your toki pona ability is small then know this: I can look at your document. When I look at your document I can communicate this: Is your method of Toki Pona good? I can communicate knowledge mistakes and method mistakes.

Number two, maybe your working ability is small in this way: Oh! You want to work, but you dismiss your work so often. You remove this knowledge: Work exists. You remove this knowledge: You want to make a document. I can offer this support: I communicate the need to work very often to you. If you want this support, then talk to me!

Number three, Maybe your artistic ability is small. Maybe you can use Toki Pona powerfully and want to make a document. But you have no idea about this: What should the document say. If you want, then you and I can talk about potential artistic things!
