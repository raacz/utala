# Place picture contest 2021-07-01

Ma Pona on Discord wanted a fun new picture. So they made this happen: many people made many possible pictures, then the group said which was the best.

In reality, two pictures were favoured by the group: *jan Melon*'s picture and *mute to*'s picture. But whereas many people voted for mute to's picture, many more people voted for jan Melon's. With this, jan Melon's server picture was first place! 

jan Melon's picture:

<img src="Melon.png" alt="jan Melon's winning contest logo presented six times, three in light mode and three in dark mode. The logo is playful and colourful and uses the 'sitelen pona' writing system" width="400">
