# What is this site?

## Beginning

The page 'utala.pona.la' is so that the Toki Pona community can engage in art battles. 

Art battles are not bad battles and are this amusement method: make lots of amusing things, like documents, colorful depictions, and communications. At the end, find this out: from the many documents and many colorful depictions and many communications, which of them is the most powerful from the perspective of the group's emotions? Many folks engage and want this: their art is the most powerful. Because of this, I use the word, 'battle.' 




## The Way of Art Battles
 
Often theway is like this:

- The head communicates a working requirement like this: 'Make an artsy document.'
- The group makes many things and gives it to the head
- The head gives all of the things back for viewing
- The group views the things and communicates this: which one is the best
