# Hey, toki pona people who write! It's that time again!

*What work is needed?*

> Write something artistic and submit it to me at the needed time. 

*What should the artistic thing be?*

> Overall there's two methods:
> - The first method is little artistic communication
> - The second method is large artistic document

> Similarities: <br>
> The little artistic communication and large artistic document should be **artistic** and use only toki pona. 

> Differences <br>
> For the little artistic communication, the word amount needs to be smaller than 300. 
> For the large artistic document, the word amount needs to be bigger than 500. 

> Submit your own work. Do not give a different person's work. 

*What should I communicate in my artistic thing?*

> Communicate anything good you want!
> Talk about a strange cosmic place that's not real, a racoon with fire powers, a book house of all knowledge, something exciting, new, and entertaining from your head and from your heart. 
> But nothing bad. Don't promote bad ideas. Don't talk too much about sex or violence.
> Also, be artistic. Your thing should not be good for Wikipedia. Do not only teach. Don't present a new toki pona numbering system. 

> Look at the competitions of the past: [utala pi lipu lili musi](/mamt/lipu-lili/) en [utala pi toki musi](/mam/toki-musi-lili). Your work should be similar. 

*When do I submit my work?*

> 2023-07-15
../
*Where do I submit my work?*

> Give your thing to me (Lakuse) using Discord (Raacz106#5873) or using email (tokipona.sasalin@gmail.com).

> Give this information:
> - your toki pona name
> - your Discord name
> - the title of your work  
> - whether your work is for the large document competition or little communication competition. 

*What is the competition*

> When submissions are all done, everyone will look at the entries and say what they think. We'll find out which aristic document and artistic communication the community thinks are the best!

> So don't send your entry to a lot of people or talk about what's in your entry to a lot of people. When it's time to look, no one should know who wrote which entry.

> Once everyone's done looking, you can talk about everything!

*What else do I need to know?*

> When you submit your thing to me, you allow [CC-BY-SA-4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/) to control the distribution of your work. If you don't like this, then don't submit! 

> If you submit work and decide you want to change it, you can resubmit it to me!

> In the large document competition, you can submit multiple documents! In the little communication competition, submit only once. 

> Know that I will keep your work on this site so everyone can look at it. If you don't like this, then don't submit!
