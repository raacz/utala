# Toki Pona community!
## The document-making event is back!

*What work is needed?*

> Compose something artistic and communicative and submit it to me at the needed time. 

*What should the artistic thing be?*

> Overall there's two methods:
> - The first method is little artistic document
> - The second method is large artistic document

> Similarities: <br>
> The little artistic document and large artistic document should be **artistic** and use only toki pona. 

> Differences <br>
> For the little artistic document, the word amount needs to be smaller than 300. 
> For the large artistic document, the word amount needs to be bigger than 500. 

> Submit your own work. Do not give a different person's work. For the big document, you can communally make a document with others at your side.

*What should I communicate in my artistic thing?*

> Communicate anything good you want!
> Talk about a strange cosmic place that's not real, a racoon with fire powers, a book house of all knowledge, something exciting, new, and entertaining from your head and from your heart. 
> But nothing bad. Don't promote bad ideas. Don't talk too much about sex or violence.
> Also, be artistic. Your thing should not be good for Wikipedia. Do not only teach. Don't present a new toki pona numbering system. 

> Look at the competitions of the past: [utala pi lipu suli pi toki lili](/mamtw/toki-en-lipu/). pali sina o sama.  Your work should be similar. 

*When do I submit my work?*

> 2024-07-15

*Where do I submit my work?*

> Give your thing to me (Lakuse) using Discord (@raacz106) or using email (tokipona.sasalin@gmail.com).

> Give this information:
> - your toki pona name
> - your Discord name
> - the title of your work  
> - whether your work is for the large document competition or little document competition. 

*What is the competition*

> When submissions are all done, everyone will look at the entries and say what they think. We'll find out which aristic documents the community thinks are the best!

> So don't send your entry to a lot of people or talk about what's in your entry to a lot of people. When it's time to look, no one should know who wrote which entry.

> Once everyone's done looking, you can talk about everything!


*What else do I need to know?*

> When you submit your thing to me, you allow [CC-BY-SA-4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/) to control the distribution of your work. If you don't like this, then don't submit! 

> If you submit work and decide you want to change it, you can resubmit it to me!

> In the large document competition, you can submit multiple documents! In the little document competition, submit only once. 

> Know that I will keep your work on this site so everyone can look at it. If you don't like this, then don't submit!

*My working ability is not very strong. What support can you offer me?*

> If your ability is small, then I (jan Lakuse) can offer support in three ways.

 > Number one, if your toki pona ability is small then know this: I can look at your document. When I look at your document I can communicate this: Is your method of Toki Pona good? I can communicate knowledge mistakes and method mistakes.

> Number two, maybe your working ability is small in this way: Oh! You want to work, but you dismiss your work so often. You remove this knowledge: Work exists. You remove this knowledge: You want to make a document. I can offer this support: I communicate the need to work very often to you. If you want this support, then talk to me!

> Number three, Maybe your artistic ability is small. Maybe you can use Toki Pona powerfully and want to make a document. But you have no idea about this: What should the document say. If you want, then you and I can talk about potential artistic things!
